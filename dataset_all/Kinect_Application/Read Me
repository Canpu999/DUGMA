Kinect Application: 30 real scences caught from two Kinect V2. In each file, there are one moving point cloud Y and its corresponding covariance Y_C, one fixed point cloud X its corresponding covariance X_C, Ground Truth R_G, t_G.   The covariance of point X(:,k) is X_C(:, 3*(k-1)+1:3k). 
The covariance of point Y(:,k) is Y_C(:, 3*(k-1)+1:3k).
